---

### **Tech Stack**:

#### **Frontend**:
- **Languages**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - **React.js**: For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
  - **Redux**: For managing state across the app (especially for user authentication and messages).
  - **React Router**: For handling routing and navigation.
  - **Material-UI**: For pre-built UI components that adhere to Google’s Material Design.
  - **Socket.io**: For real-time messaging and session notifications.
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

#### **Backend**:
- **Languages**: Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Framework**: Express.js (for handling HTTP requests and server-side logic)
- **Database**: 
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store user profiles, posts, messages, and session data (scalable and flexible for handling different data types).
  - **Mongoose**: For schema definition and interaction with MongoDB.
- **Authentication**:
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
  - **Passport.js**: For handling authentication strategies like local login and OAuth (Google login, etc.).
- **WebSockets**: **Socket.io** for real-time messaging and live sessions.
- **Cloud Storage**: **AWS S3** for storing user-uploaded content (e.g., images, videos, etc.).

#### **Deployment**:
- **Hosting**: 
  - **Heroku** or **Vercel** for deploying the backend and frontend.
  - **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) or **DigitalOcean** for handling more scalable and production-ready hosting.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automating deployment pipelines.

#### **Additional Tools**:
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management.
- **Testing**: 
  - **Jest** (for unit tests in React).
  - **Mocha/Chai** (for backend API testing).
- **Code Quality**: ESLint for maintaining code quality standards.
